# LaTeX figures cleaner
## What is this?
Use this tool to delete unused (obsolete) graphic files in a LaTeX project in a specified directory. When often switching figrues, many files get layed up which are not needed anymore. Also useful when using GIT to stop versioning obsolete figures.

## Usage
Specify 'directory' and 'logfile' in the source code and copy the file in the LaTeX root directory. Then just run the tool. Console output will give feedback what files are deleted.
